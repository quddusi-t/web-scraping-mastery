# E-commerce API Scraper

A professional-grade API scraper demonstrating advanced web scraping techniques through reverse engineering and intelligent fallback strategies. Built using real-world e-commerce site analysis.

## ✨ Features

- **🕵️ API Discovery**: Reverse-engineered through browser DevTools analysis
- **🛡️ Multi-Strategy Architecture**: Intelligent fallback system with 3+ approaches
- **📊 Professional Analytics**: Built-in data analysis and insights
- **💾 Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, CSV, and summary reports
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized with session management and smart pacing
- **🔧 Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## 🎯 The Technical Breakthrough

This scraper was created through professional API reverse engineering:

1. **DevTools Detective Work**: Used browser network inspection to discover hidden API endpoints
2. **Header Analysis**: Extracted authentic browser headers using cURL conversion
3. **Strategy Testing**: Developed multiple approaches with intelligent fallback
4. **Optimization**: Built robust session management with anti-detection techniques

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Layer Strategy System
- **Strategy 1**: Simple headers (often sufficient)
- **Strategy 2**: Advanced cURL headers (browser-identical)  
- **Strategy 3**: Dynamic multi-session rotation

### Professional Error Handling
- Graceful 404 handling
- Automatic strategy switching
- Session timeout protection
- Rate limiting compliance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-mastery.git
cd web-scraping-mastery/ecommerce-api-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from ecommerce_api_scraper import ECommerceAPIScraperV12

# Initialize scraper
scraper = ECommerceAPIScraperV12()

# Search products with intelligent fallback
products = scraper.search_products_ultimate("laptop", pages=5)

# Analyze results
scraper.analyze_results(products)

# Save in multiple formats
scraper.save_ultimate(products, "laptop")
```

## 📊 Sample Output

The scraper extracts comprehensive product data:

```json
{
  "product_id": "HBC00008748TY",
  "name": "Apple MacBook Air M4 16GB 256GB SSD",
  "brand": "Apple", 
  "price": 51999.0,
  "original_price": 51999.0,
  "discount_rate": 0,
  "currency": "TRY",
  "savings": 0.0,
  "scraped_at": "2025-08-27T03:31:02.389"
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Headers Strategy
```python
# Use specific header strategy
scraper = ECommerceAPIScraperV12()
products = scraper._scrape_with_headers(
    keyword="smartphone", 
    pages=3, 
    headers=custom_headers,
    strategy_name="CUSTOM"
)
```

### Multi-Category Scraping
```python
# Scrape multiple product categories
categories = ["laptop", "phone", "tablet"]
for category in categories:
    products = scraper.search_products_ultimate(category, pages=3)
    scraper.save_ultimate(products, category)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Speed**: ~11 seconds for 8 products across multiple pages
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ with fallback strategies
- **Data Quality**: 100% field completion rate
- **Error Resilience**: Handles API changes gracefully
